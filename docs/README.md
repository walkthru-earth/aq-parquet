# Documentation router

The device protocol, telemetry format, and offline-first data flow are shared across board trials. Wiring, power, peripheral ownership, build settings, and measured performance belong to the individual board. Source-checked claims and real-device results remain separate.

## Project and sensor sets

This is general OpenSensor firmware for any measurement. Air quality is the
first sensor set, not the whole product. Four terms describe how it fits
together.

- A **Thing** is one deployed device with a persistent UUID. Its files land
  under `output/thing=<UUID>/` and it can move between places.
- A **board app** is one self-contained native ESP-IDF application under
  `firmware/esp-idf-<board>/`. It owns pins, power, peripherals, storage
  mounting and acquisition, and it records its own bench evidence.
- A **sensor set** is the group of measurements a board app collects. The board
  declares it in its field dictionary, `telemetry_fields.inc`, which fixes the
  Parquet columns, units and LIVE keys, and fills each row in `Hooks::collect`.
  Air quality is sensor set 1, with a Plantower particle sensor on both
  current boards. On CoreS3 it is the optional M134 add-on, on Waveshare V2 a
  wired PMS5003T.
- The **shared components** in [`firmware/common`](../firmware/common/README.md)
  are board and sensor neutral. They sample, write Parquet, keep settings and
  sync over BLE and LAN for any sensor set.

To add a board or a new sensor set, start with
[board porting](shared/board-porting.md). A sensor plugin design is planned at
`docs/shared/sensor-plugins.md`. Current board versions live in the
[root README status table](../README.md#status).

## Boards

| Board | Status | Reference |
| --- | --- | --- |
| M5Stack CoreS3 with optional M134/PMSA003 | Native OSLogger adapter with a short native USB/SD/sensor/time readback. Proto 3 phone transfers and endurance remain pending. Historical Arduino radio evidence stays image-specific | [CoreS3 board docs](boards/m5stack-cores3/README.md), [trial](../firmware/esp-idf-cores3/README.md) |
| Waveshare ESP32-S3-SIM7670G-4G V2 with PMS5003T | Native ESP-IDF logger and retained diagnostic with a short native USB/SD readback. Phone transfers and endurance remain pending. Historical Arduino evidence stays in its bench record | [Waveshare board docs](boards/waveshare-esp32-s3-sim7670g/README.md), [trial](../firmware/esp-idf-waveshare-sim7670g/README.md) |

The seven shared ESP-IDF components are OSCommon (encoding and the Parquet writer), OSSensors (sensor drivers),
OSRuntime (settings/logs), OSConnectivity (local transports), OSLogger (sampling/archive worker),
OSLocation (official H3 geometry) and `power` (battery health classifier). A shared
source or host gate is not a hardware endurance result.

For any physical write, follow the board-specific safety sequence in [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md). Keep captures and firmware binaries in the relevant trial's ignored `artifacts/`, and record real-board measurements only in that board's bench record.
