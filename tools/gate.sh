# Host gate shared by local runs and CI. Run it as `pixi run gate`.

# Every task below is an existing pixi task, run with its sanitizer flag when
# the script supports one. Tasks that need a board, a serial port, Bluetooth,
# a LAN peer, the network or the ESP-IDF SDK are deliberately absent. The SDK
# builds run in the CI board job instead.
#
# Each task runs under GNU timeout from the pixi coreutils pin. A task that
# outlives OS_GATE_TASK_TIMEOUT seconds (default 300) is stopped, reported as
# TIMEOUT by name, and killed 10 s later if it ignores SIGTERM. Anything left
# in the task's process group is then killed, so no stray process outlives it.
#
# Usage: tools/gate.sh [--keep-going]
#   --keep-going  run every task and report all failures at the end
