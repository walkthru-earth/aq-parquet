"""Static stack worst case per task and linker section sizes per image (issue #37).

Board builds compile every object with `-fstack-usage -fcallgraph-info=su`
(firmware/cmake/aq_stack_usage.cmake), so GCC leaves a `.ci` call graph with
each function's frame size next to every object. This tool joins those graphs,
walks them from each tracked task's entry and prints the deepest path. Functions
with no `.ci` (prebuilt newlib, libgcc and the Wi-Fi and Bluetooth blobs) take
their frame from the `entry a1, N` instruction and their calls from the
disassembly of the linked ELF. ROM functions have neither and count as zero.

Calls through a function pointer resolve to the `indirect` rules in
tools/stack_budget.json. A rule names the callers it applies to and the
functions they may reach, so a pointer call reaches only reviewed targets. One
path takes at most `indirect_depth` pointer calls (2 unless the task says
otherwise, an event loop calling a library handler that calls our hook). A
pointer call past that, or one no rule covers, is counted as unresolved and
adds nothing.
Recursion is cut where it closes and flagged, and so are frames GCC marks
dynamic (alloca or a variable length array). Both mean the figure is not a
bound, so a flagged function in our code needs a reviewed depth cap or an
iterative rewrite.

The worst case excludes the interrupt context frame and register window
spills that FreeRTOS keeps on a task stack, see `reserve_bytes` in the budget
file. It is a static estimate, a bench high water mark (`parquet mem`) is the
measured counterpart.

`--check` also fails on a tracked task with no budget, and it scans repo
firmware (comments and string contents skipped) for every `xTaskCreate*` call in a file the image
links (any of its functions in the call graph). Each one must name a tracked
task (`task_name`, the task key by default) whose `stack_bytes` equals the
stack size in source, so a new task or a resized stack cannot pass unnoticed.
A call it cannot parse, such as a lambda entry or a name in a variable, fails,
and so does a second creation site for one tracked task name.

The scan does not evaluate the preprocessor. Every branch of every `#if`,
`#elif` and `#else` is scanned, `#if 0` included, so a call in any branch must
name a tracked task whose `stack_bytes` matches its stack. Two calls with one
task name pass the one site rule only when they sit in different branches of
the same `#if` group, since at most one of them is compiled. Calls in sibling
files, or in the same branch, still count as two sites.

Usage:
  pixi run stack-budget                         # every image with a build
  pixi run stack-budget --image cores3/bringup --path
  pixi run stack-budget --check --image waveshare/logger   # CI, fails past budget
  pixi run stack-budget --write-budgets         # after a reviewed change
