// BLE link authentication policy (issue #51). Pure decisions with no host
// stack or RTOS dependency, so ble_sync.cpp and the host tests share them.
//
// NimBLE's security state for the connection is the truth. The transport keeps
// an atomic copy so the response gates need no host lock per frame, and that
// copy used to change only on CONNECT and ENC_CHANGE. On some bonded
// reconnects ENC_CHANGE never reached the GAP callback, so the copy stayed
// false while every GATT access saw a secure link. The first LIST was then
// refused with ERROR 7 and that ERROR was dropped by the same stale gate.
//
// Now every host task place that reads the live state (CONNECT, ENC_CHANGE,
// SUBSCRIBE and each GATT access) latches the copy, and each gate falls back
// to the live state before it refuses. An insecure link is still refused,
// never with 7. NimBLE's ATT permission check refuses it first, with the same
// rule as secure() in this configuration (ENC flags in every mode, AUTHEN and
// sm_sc_only, which also demands a 16 byte key, in the passkey modes). That
// ATT error is what makes the phone pair. ERROR 14 is a guarded fallback in
// case the two checks ever diverge.
