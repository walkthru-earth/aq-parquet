# Optional native H3 location component

`src/aq_location.*` is board-neutral, stateless C++ wrapping the official H3 C
library. It does not initialize controllers, read GPS, perform network lookups,
write NVS or infer country. Missing location remains missing.

- Preserve the exact H3 version/tag/commit and all vendored bytes, license and
  notice under `vendor/h3/`; CMake and host tests verify `manifest.json` hashes.
- Privacy coarsening calls H3 `cellToParent`, never invents bit arithmetic or a
  geographic replacement. Increasing maximum resolution cannot upsample an
  already coarsened cell; fresh owner provisioning is required for finer data.
- Persist only the published/coarsened cell. Center values come from that same
  cell and are approximate deployment geometry, not retained GPS coordinates.
- Country is optional, owner-declared ISO 3166-1 alpha-2; validate assigned codes
  using the documented snapshot and never claim H3 provides country boundaries.
- Host gates compile actual C++ helpers and exact official C sources through
  pinned Pixi. They prove indexing/validation/privacy logic, not board GPS,
  persistent storage or hardware behavior.
