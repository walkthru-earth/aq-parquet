# Third-party notices

This repository and the firmware images built from it contain work by
[Walkthru.Earth](https://walkthru.earth) and work by third parties.

The [CC BY 4.0 license](LICENSE) covers only original Walkthru.Earth work. It
does not relicense any third-party component listed here. Each component keeps
its own license, copyright headers and NOTICE files, and those terms apply when
you copy the source or ship a binary that contains it.

If you distribute a firmware image (`.bin`, `.elf` or a merged flash image) built
from this repository, ship this file together with the license texts referenced
below, and keep the visible Walkthru.Earth credit described in the
[README](README.md#license-and-attribution).

The firmware inventory below was taken from the ESP32-S3 linker maps of the
`esp-idf-cores3` and `esp-idf-waveshare-sim7670g` builds against the pinned
ESP-IDF in [`tools/idf-dependencies.lock`](tools/idf-dependencies.lock)
(ESP-IDF v6.1, commit `fff9895c82d744c7237be8847347bdd1b07c6643`), and each
license was checked against the license files, SPDX headers and `sbom.yml`
manifests in that source tree. Only ESP32-S3 is hardware verified.

## 1. Third-party code vendored in this repository

Notes

- Only the LZ4 `lib/` sources (`lz4.c`, `lz4.h`) are vendored, and those are
  BSD-2-Clause. Other parts of the upstream LZ4 repository, such as the
  command-line programs, use different licenses and are not included here. See
  [`firmware/common/vendor/lz4/README.md`](firmware/common/vendor/lz4/README.md)
  for the pinned source and hashes.
- The H3 sources are unmodified upstream files verified against
  [`manifest.json`](firmware/common/location/vendor/h3/manifest.json). The
  Apache-2.0 `NOTICE` file must accompany any binary that contains H3 code.
- The esp-nimble patch changes one NimBLE host file, `ble_hs_hci.c`, at
  build time. The build compiles a patched copy in place of the SDK file, and
  the patched code stays Apache-2.0. See
  [`firmware/common/vendor/esp-nimble/README.md`](firmware/common/vendor/esp-nimble/README.md)
  for the pinned hashes and the upstream commits.

## 3. ESP-IDF v6.1 framework linked into the firmware

ESP-IDF is Copyright Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD and is licensed under
Apache-2.0 unless a component states otherwise. Espressif components used by the
firmware (drivers, HAL, `esp_system`, `esp_wifi`, `esp_netif`, `nvs_flash`,
`spi_flash`, `vfs`, `esp_pm`, `esp_psram`, `sdmmc`, `bt`, the bootloader and
others) are Apache-2.0. The upstream projects bundled inside ESP-IDF that end up
in the linked image are listed below.

| Component | ESP-IDF path | Version | License | Copyright |

## 4. Toolchain runtime libraries linked into the firmware

ESP-IDF v6.1 builds this firmware with picolibc (`CONFIG_LIBC_PICOLIBC=y`), not
newlib. The libraries below come from the Espressif `xtensa-esp-elf` GCC 15.2.0
toolchain. Their license texts ship with the toolchain under
`xtensa-esp-elf/share/licenses/`.

| Component | Version | License | Copyright |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| picolibc C library | 1.8.10 | BSD-3-Clause and other permissive licenses inherited from newlib, see `share/licenses/picolibc/COPYING.picolibc` | Copyright 2019 Keith Packard, The Newlib Project and others |
| GCC runtime (`libgcc`) and C++ library (`libstdc++`) | GCC 15.2.0 | GPL-3.0-or-later WITH GCC-exception-3.1 | Copyright Free Software Foundation, Inc. |

The GCC Runtime Library Exception allows these libraries to be linked into
firmware under any license.

## 5. Managed components from the ESP Component Registry

Versions are pinned in each board's `dependencies.lock` and component
`idf_component.yml` and track the latest stable releases. They describe builds
from current source. Older images may contain earlier versions of the same
components, which carry the same licenses and copyright notices.

| Component | Version | Used by | License | Copyright |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `espressif/mdns` | 1.14.0 | CoreS3, Waveshare SIM7670G | Apache-2.0 | Copyright Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD |
| `espressif/led_strip` | 3.1.0~1 | Waveshare SIM7670G | Apache-2.0 | Copyright Espressif Systems (Shanghai) CO LTD |
| `m5stack/m5unified` | 0.2.26 | CoreS3 | MIT | Copyright (c) 2021 M5Stack |
| `m5stack/m5gfx` | 0.2.33 | CoreS3 | MIT, with bundled third-party parts listed below | Copyright (c) 2021 M5Stack |

M5GFX bundles code and fonts under their own licenses, as listed in its README.
LovyanGFX (BSD-2-Clause FreeBSD, lovyan03), TJpgDec (ChaN), Pngle (MIT,
kikuchan), QRCode (MIT, Richard Moore and Nayuki), result (MIT, Matthew
Rodusek), Adafruit GFX and GLCD fonts (BSD-2-Clause, Adafruit Industries),
TFT_eSPI fonts 2, 4, 6, 7 and 8 (BSD-2-Clause FreeBSD, Bodmer), converted IPA
fonts (IPA Font License), efont (BSD-3-Clause, The Electronic Font Open
Laboratory) and the TomThumb font (BSD-3-Clause). Only the parts the CoreS3
firmware references are linked, but the M5GFX license files should travel with
any CoreS3 image.

## 6. Host tools, not shipped in firmware

The Python and C++ host tools under [`tools/`](tools) run on a developer machine
and are not part of any firmware image. Their dependencies, such as Python,
pyarrow, DuckDB, bleak, pyserial, esptool, CMake, Ninja, clang-tools and
cppcheck, are installed by [Pixi](pixi.toml) from conda-forge and PyPI under
their own licenses and are not redistributed by this repository.
